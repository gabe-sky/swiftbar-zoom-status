# Zoom Audio/Video State

This repository contains two SwiftBar plug-ins that indicate Zoom's current state of the microphone and camera.  That's it.  That's all they do.

To use this, you will need to [install SwiftBar](https://github.com/swiftbar/SwiftBar) and Apple's [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) package.

Credit for the original work belongs to Dave Look and Nick Turner.  I simply changed it up so that the colors suit me.  Green means your device is active, and red reminds you that "you're on mute, buddy."
